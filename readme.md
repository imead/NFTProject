### Project Overview:
Found this dataset from Data Are Plural, stored on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simiotic/ethereum-nfts). Open data from Moonstream.to.

Going into this project am just beginning in Julia and also have never worked with a SQLite database before. I am also going to be tracking this project in Github to try to improve at that type of documentation. I plan on building a Tableau Public dashboard as the end point of the analysis in Julia.

### Dataset Information:
Dates from 04/01/2021 to 09/25/2021.

Important events are: Mints: event on blockchain marking creation of new NFT. Transfers: event when NFT ownership is changed.

Only have limited understanding of NFTs and how they are stored on the blockchain, will need to develop better understanding of the subject and process before proceeding with analysis.
